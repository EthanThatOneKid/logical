# Logical 🧝‍♂️

> "Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end of it." — Spock

## About

If you would like to quickly log anywhere on your machine, you have come to the right place, logically speaking.
Simply, run `logical hello world` after installing the script on your machine to save a simple `log.txt` file in your current directory.
Combine this with Git for a version-controlled logging ecosystem.
